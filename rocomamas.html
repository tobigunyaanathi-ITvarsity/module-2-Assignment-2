    <p><strong>Rocomamas</strong></p>
    <p>Founded in July 2013, RocoMamas has fast become o‌ne of the trendiest restaurants in South Africa, garnering a loyal following of burger enthusiasts. Their brand position of “Not Normal” is evident in their funky décor, rock ‘n roll vibe, unique menu items and an open-style kitchen where customers can see (and smell) the meals being prepared. This new concept is a result of the growing appetite for hand-made food and a more personalised dining experience. Customers can sit down and soak up the laid-back vibe with a burger and craft beer, or choose to order a takeaway thanks to the speedy service. RocoMamas has a menu that goes far beyond your typical burger joint; it’s all about customisation.</p>
